## Allow everybody to sign digital documents, for free:

We believe allowing everybody to be sign their digital documents is an essential step to improve security. This can prevent impersonation and when a massive mass is reached, it is possible to automatically prevent non-signed software to execute. Sig4all believe it can reach this goal by offering free certificates to every users.

## Make signing code easy, fast and secure.

In order to sign digital documents, a user needs to have access to his private key. Storing the key locally can be difficult to do securely and conveniently. Sig4all wants to simplify this by allowing users to sign their code through a web service.

## Enable organizations and teams to sign as one.

In order to sign digital documents, somebody needs to be able to encrypt information with a private key. This private key is a secret that can't be changed and shouldn't be solved. Sharing this private key necessarily increase the risk of loosing the key and allowing malicious persons to sign documents as you. Sig4all solve this problem by never giving away the private key. Instead, the encryption is done on the server, after authenticating the user requesting the signing.
